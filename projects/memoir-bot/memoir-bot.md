# MEMOIR TWITTER BOT

My friend Natalie kept sending me silly memoir titles she was coming up with. I had also just completed a computational poetry workshop with [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/).

I wanted to try out my own project, so I made this Twitter bot to generate memoir titles using [Tracery](https://tracery.io/).

Here's the [repository](https://github.com/trudypainter/memoir-title-generator).

And, check out the [Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/memoirmaker).
