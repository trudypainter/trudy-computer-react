# SPOTIFY MOOD TRACKER v1.0

I wanted a way to track my mood with no extra effort. So, over the summer of 2020, I made [trudy.tube](http://www.trudy.tube/). It tracks all of my listening history and generates a graph of mood indices calculated by song valence, energy, and danceability.

Below is a diagram of how the system works. Check out the website [here](http://www.trudy.tube/) as well.

Or, take a look at [how I made this.](https://github.com/trudypainter/spotify-mood)
