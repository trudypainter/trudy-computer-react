# REAL TALK RADIO

For the summer of 2020, I worked on Real Talk Radio under Ekene Ijeoma with the Poetic Justice Group at the MIT Media Lab.

Real Talk Radio is a continuous broadcasting system. It contains spoken word song introductions in Black music from hip hop to jazz as a form of Black thought and knowledge. These introductions often include personal musings filled with inspiration, insight, and spirituality.

I worked as a music researcher and web developer for this project. I...

1. Curated over 500 song clips

2. Coded a broadcasting system to stream and crossfade the clips

3. Created a Python backend automation system to update human curator changes and leveraged Google Sheets to create a custom API for the frontend stream.

Below is a diagram of the system.
