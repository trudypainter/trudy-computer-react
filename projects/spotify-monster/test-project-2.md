# SPOTIFY MONSTER

In the spring of my sophomore year, I took MIT's embedded systems class. For the final project, my group and I created a network of Tamagotchi-like creatures that were fed based off Spotify listening history. We used a Python web server, SQL database, Arduino with C++, and the Spotify API. We also created a web interface to view other monsters and compatibility scores between users.
